    <h1> This is ball </h1>
    <div class="wtf_is_ball">
        <p> The plan is to have the ball move on click
            and do the other things. Not because they are easy
            but beauce they are hard.
            So far we have have the following.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A CSS ball based on a DIV </li>
            <li>A color on the ball</li>
            <li>A drop shadow on the ball</li>
            <li>A position on the ball set by margins</li>
            <li>Shadows</li>
            <li> JS linked and onclick of ball is beeping</li>
            <li> r rand in max 500 for the 4 margins on click</li>
        </ol>
