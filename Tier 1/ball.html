        <h1> This is ball </h1>
        <div class="wtf_is_ball">
        <p> The plan is to have the ball move on click
            and do the other things. So far we have have the following.
        </p>
<ol>
<li>A CSS ball based on a DIV </li>
<li>A color on the ball</li>
<li>A drop shadow on the ball</li>
<li>A position on the ball set by margins</li>
</ol>
        </div>
<div class="ball"></div>
