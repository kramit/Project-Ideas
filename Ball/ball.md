# Spec


Create a HTML and CSS page with a single ball in the center, when the ball is clicked it jumps to a random position on the page and changes to a random colour

## To Do

#### HTML

Boilerplate code to make HTML page
DIV tag that will be manipulated by CSS later
Set class of the DIV to be ball


#### CSS

.ball needs to have the following

* a colour
* a size
* a shadow
* a position

##### Secondary

* a hover action to flash or do somthing to make it known there is a hover 
* hover action to change the pointer
* make a beep on click (does this get done in the JS?)


#### JS


##### Primordial 

* link the JS to the HTML

* do a  console.log("test") and check that works

##### First 

* Mapping the DOM (map the HTML elements to variables)

* figure out how to do an OnClick action for an element

* First OnClick action can change the background colour of the div element to another color


#### Second

* Make random numbers, these will be used to fill in the positions of the balls and seleect the colours

* make an array of the colours

* change the on click action to run a function that makes the selection and changes the DOM
